What is DevOps
DevOps is a process of improving the appilcation/script delivery by ensuring that there is proper Automation with a Code Quality that is maintained and ensuring that there is a Continuous Monitoring and Continuous Testing in place.

Why DevOps?
DevOps is a Culture/Methodology/way of working process to increase the efficiency and improves the delivery process by involving Automation, Quality, Monitoring & Testing and using CI/CD Process.

I am a DevOps engineer, i have overall 3 years of expireance in devops and before that i was working as system admin, BRE(Build & Release Engineer), System Administrator, Site Reliability Engineer and as a Support Engineer for Test Equipments & Utilization Monitoring. 

In Current organization, i can take care of Automation, Quality, Monitoring, Testing.

Class-3 & Class-4 : To Create and Connect to Virtual Machines 

Class-5: How to Connect to EC2 Instance
1) Login to AWS UI--> EC2 instances --> Click on Instance --> AWS Console --> Connect 
2) Putty 
3) MobaXterm
4) AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open source tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. 
Install AWS CLI
aws --version to check
ssh ubuntu@13.127.127.119
ssh -i C:\Users\venka\Downloads\myawskey.pem ubuntu@13.127.127.119  ---  Now it is connected to EC2 Instance

aws configure ---> enter below Access key & password & region credwntials
Create AWS Access Key: AKIA6PKFKO46TRXUNXOG  --> Password: Ux+hr1HvIAxvD3HVFVTEBWcQPLt0RGy2tNOA0jzD
region: ap-south-1


Class-6: Why Linux is so Popular than other operating systems?
Linux is a Free, Open Source Secure, Distribution and Fast Operating System over windows.

What is Kernel in OS.
Kernerl is a heart of the any Operating System which does Device Management, Memory, Process, and Handling System calls.

Fundamentals of Shell Scripting:
Shell is a way that talk to Operating system. Linux having Centos, Fedora & Ubuntu distributions. Ubuntu is widly used in Linux Operating System.

Most of the GUI will not install in Linux beacuse it comes some weight to the machine and it will be slow means OS GUI and Server will be heavy. thats why in most of the time we won't use GUI in production environment. Most of the time we use shell commands to talk to the distribution or OS to create a required files and directories.

Shell Scripting: Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks and execute commands in a Unix or Unix-like operating system using a shell, which is a command-line interface to interact with the operating system.

Shell commands which we use daily day to day basis:

ls: listing the files and folders
ls -ltr: list all the files & folders with properties
ls -al: list all the files & folders with hidden
pwd: present working directory: always
cd: change directory
touch: to create a file
vi: to create a file & write someting inside the file
cat: to print file like which is present inside of the file
mkdir: to create a directory
rm: to remove a file
rm -r: to remove a directory
clear: to clear the screen

free -mg: to know the memory of your computer
nproc: to know the cpu count and details
df -h: to know the disk space & details
top: we can get the complete information of cpu, memory and details using the top command. this command is used to whole management.


Class-7: AWS Project using SHELL SCRIPTING for DevOps:

To ensure that a certain script runs every day at a specific time, you can use a combination of scheduling tools available on Unix-like operating systems. The most commonly used scheduling tools are cron (on Unix and Linux systems) and Task Scheduler (on Windows systems). I'll explain how to achieve this using cron as it is widely used on Unix-like systems.

Cron Job using Shell Scripting & AWS CLI:
Open a terminal or shell.
bash: prefer bash why because bash is one of the widly used scriptings. so go for bash

aws configure: run the aws configure command and provide access and secret keys.
